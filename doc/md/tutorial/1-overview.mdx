# Tutorial

Holos is a configuration management tool for Kubernetes resources.  It provides
the building blocks needed for implementing the [rendered manifests pattern].
It gives the flexibility to manage a wide range of configurations, from large
software delivery platforms spanning multiple clusters and regions to generating
a single resource on your local device.

At a high level, Holos provides a few major components:

- A Platform schema for specifying how components integrate together into a platform.
- Component building blocks for Helm, Kustomize, and Kubernetes to unify configuration with CUE.
- A BuildPlan orchestrating generators, transformers, and validators to produce manifest files.
