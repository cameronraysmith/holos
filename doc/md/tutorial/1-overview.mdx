# Tutorial

Holos is a configuration management tool for Kubernetes resources.  It provides
the building blocks needed for implementing the [rendered manifests pattern].
It gives the flexibility to manage a wide range of configurations, from large
software delivery platforms spanning multiple clusters and regions to generating
a single resource on your local device.

At a high level, Holos provides a few major components:

- A Platform schema for specifying how components integrate together into a platform.
- Component building blocks for Helm, Kustomize, and Kubernetes to unify configuration with CUE.
- A BuildPlan orchestrating generators, transformers, and validators to produce manifest files.

## Holos' role in your organization

Platform engineers run the `holos render platform` command locally and in CI to
produce Kubernetes manifests which are committed to version control.  GitOps
tools like ArgoCD or Flux deploy the manifests produced by Holos.

Other tools focus on individual applications.  Holos focuses holistically on the
integration of applications into a whole platform.  In this way a single one
line configuration change, like changing the domain name, is clearly visible
across the whole platform.

Rendering a platform may produce a single ConfigMap resource or produce millions
of lines of fully rendered manifests configuring multiple environments,
clusters, and regions.

## Advantages of Holos

This section outlines some advantages of Holos.

### Safe

Holos uses [CUE] to provide strong typing and constraints to configuration data.
Additionally, holos adds strong validation to verify the output produced by Helm
and other tools.

### Consistent

Holos offers a consistent way to incorporate a wide variety of tools into a well
defined data pipeline.  Configuration produced from CUE, Helm, and Kustomize are
all handled with the same consistent process.

### Easy

Holos makes it easy to define configuration data once, then safely use the data
in multiple Helm charts, Kustomize bases, or any other supported component kind.

### Flexible

Holos is designed to be flexible.  Holos offers flexible building blocks for
data generation, transformation, validation, and integration.  Find the perfect
fit for your team by assembling these building blocks to your unique needs.

Holos does not have an opinion on many common aspects of platform configuration.
For example, environments and clusters are explicitly kept out of the core and
instead are provided as flexible, user-customizable [topics] organized as a
recipes.

## When not to use Holos

Although Holos is useful for many organizations that need to do manage
configuration, there are also some use-cases where Holos is not a good fit.

### Implicit GitOps

Holos takes an explicit view of GitOps, meaning the fully rendered manifests are
complete.  These manifests are stored in version control without an implicit
dependency on external systems.  If your team uses an implicit approach, meaning
some configuration comes from elsewhere, then Holos may not be a good fit.

For example, if container image tags are managed by a system outside of version
control then holos may not be a good fit.

Holos is a good fit if you're open to integrate external systems with Holos such
that the external data becomes an input to produce the fully rendered manifests.

### CUE is a Non Starter

Holos heavily uses CUE.  For example, when using Holos with Helm and Kustomize,
we no longer need to write YAML files and text templates.  All configuration is
expressed in CUE and `holos` handles the YAML on our behalf.

CUE is a relatively simple domain specific language, but it is very different
from most other languages because of it's roots in logic programming languages.

Holos is not a good fit if your team prefers to write code in YAML templates or
turing complete general purpose languages.

## Getting Help

If you get stuck, you can get help on [Discord] or [GitHub discussions].  Don't
worry about asking "beginner" questions, configuration is often complex even for
the most experienced among us.  We all start somewhere and are happy to help.
