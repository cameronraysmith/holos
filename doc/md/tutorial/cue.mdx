# CUE

Concepts to cover:

1. CUE is used in multiple ways.
2. Generating resources.
3. Validating rendered output.
4. Injecting values to Helm and Kustomize
5. As a better alternative to YAML when working with Kustomize.

Important details:

1. Resources are validated against `#Resources` defined at the root.
2. Custom Resource Definitions need to be imported with timoni.
3. Helm, Kustomize, and CUE can be mixed in together in the same Holos
Component.
