# Setup

This tutorial will guide you through the installation of Holos and its
dependencies, as well as the initialization of a minimal Platform that you can
extend to meet your specific needs.

## Prerequisites

Holos integrates with the following tools that should be installed to enable
their functionality.

* [Helm] to fetch and render Helm chart Components [Kubectl] to [kustomize]
* components.

## Install Holos

Holos is distributed as a single file executable that can be installed in a couple of ways.

### Releases

Download `holos` from the [releases] page and place the executable into your
shell path.

### Go install

Alternatively, install directly into your go bin path using:

```shell
go install github.com/holos-run/holos/cmd/holos@latest
```

## Generate a new Platform

Use `holos` to generate a minimal platform using the recommended directory
structure.  First, create and cd into a blank directory. Then use the `holos
generate platform` command to generate a minimal platform.

```shell
mkdir holos-tutorial
cd holos-tutorial
holos generate platform v1alpha5
```

Holos creates a `platform` directory containing a `platform.gen.cue` file
serving as the entry point for your new platform configuration.  You'll register
software components with the platform using the CUE code in this `platform`
directory.

Platform components are parameterized.  The Platform spec can re-use the same
component providing it with different input parameters.  

:::tip
Holos makes it easy to re-use a Helm chart with multiple customers and
environments.  This is not well supported by Helm alone.
:::

## Render the Platform

We usually make configuration changes with holos in the following loop:

1. Edit some CUE code.
2. Render the whole platform.
3. Review the fully rendered manifests.
4. Repeat

Rendering the platform to plain manifest files allows us to see the changes
clearly.

```bash
holos render platform ./platform
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="output" label="Output">
```txt
rendered platform in 8.292Âµs
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="diagram" label="Diagram">
    <RenderPlatformDiagram />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this initial state `holos` doesn't do anything because no components are
registered with the platform.  You can inspect the Platform definition to get
this insight.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="output" label="Output">

```
Note the `spec.components` field is empty.

</Tabs>


## Next Steps

You've got the structure of your platform configuration in place. Continue on to
[Hello Holos] where you'll learn how easy it is to manage a Helm chart with
holos.

## Do I need Kubernetes?

No.  Holos generates fully rendered Kubernetes manifests but does not apply
them.  You don't need a Kubernetes cluster to start using Holos and reviewing
the files it creates.

You will need a cluster to apply the rendered manifests and interact with the
resources and services Holos configures.  We recommend using our [Local Cluster]
guide to set up a minimal [k3d] Kubernetes cluster with [OrbStack] or [Docker].
You might like our [Local Cluster] guide because it:

1. Includes a script to quickly reset the cluster to a known good state.
2. Configures proper DNS and TLS certificates.
