# localhost Guide

In this guide you'll set up a Cluster on your local host to apply and explore
the configuration described in our other guides.  Most of our guides are written
to be read without requiring you to apply configuration to a Cluster.

After completing this guide you'll have a real Kubernetes API server suitable
for use with our other guides, and you'll be able to easily reset the cluster to
a known good state for the purpose of developing you Platform with Holos.

The [Concepts](/docs/concepts) page defines capitalized terms such as Platform
and Component.

## What you'll need {#requirements}

You'll need the following tools installed to complete this guide.

1. [holos](/docs/install) - to build the platform.
2. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - to render Holos components that wrap upstream Helm charts.
3. [k3d](https://k3d.io/#installation) - to provide a k8s api server.
4. [OrbStack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - to use k3d.
5. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - to interact with the k8s api server.
6. [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) - to make trusted TLS certificates.
7. [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) - to fiddle with JSON output.

## Configure DNS {#configure-dns}

Configure your machine to resolve `*.holos.localhost` to your loopback
interface.  This is necessary for requests to reach the workload cluster.  Save
this script to a file and execute it.

```bash showLineNumbers
#! /bin/bash
#

set -euo pipefail

tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)"
finish() {
  [[ -d "$tmpdir" ]] && rm -rf "$tmpdir"
}
trap finish EXIT
cd "$tmpdir"

brew install dnsmasq

cat <<EOF >"$(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.d/holos.localhost.conf"
# Refer to https://holos.run/docs/tutorial/local/k3d/
address=/holos.localhost/127.0.0.1
EOF

if [[ -r /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist ]]; then
  echo "dnsmasq already configured"
else
  sudo cp "$(brew list dnsmasq | grep 'dnsmasq.plist$')" \
    /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
  sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
  sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
  dscacheutil -flushcache
  echo "dnsmasq configured"
fi

sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver
sudo tee /etc/resolver/holos.localhost <<EOF
domain holos.localhost
nameserver 127.0.0.1
EOF
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

echo "all done."
```

## Create the Cluster {#create-the-cluster}

The Workload Cluster is where your applications and services will be deployed.
In production this is usually an EKS, GKE, or AKS cluster.

:::tip

Holos supports all compliant Kubernetes clusters. Holos was developed and tested
on GKE, EKS, Talos, k3s, and Kubeadm clusters.

:::

Create a local registry to speed up image builds and pulls.

```bash
k3d registry create registry.holos.localhost --port 5100
```

Create the workload cluster configured to use the local registry.

```bash
k3d cluster create workload \
  --registry-use k3d-registry.holos.localhost:5100 \
  --port "443:443@loadbalancer" \
  --k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:0"
```

Traefik is disabled because Istio provides the same functionality.

## Setup Root CA {#setup-root-ca}

Platforms most often use cert-manager to issue tls certificates.  The browser
and tools we're using need to trust these certificates to work together.
Generate a local, trusted root certificate authority with the following script.

Admin access is necessary for `mkcert` to manage the certificate into your trust
stores.

```bash
sudo -v
```

Manage the local CA and copy the CA key to the workload cluster so that cert
manager can manage trusted certificates.

Save this script to a file and execute it to configure a trusted certificate
authority.

```bash showLineNumbers
#! /bin/bash
#

set -euo pipefail

mkcert --install

tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)"
finish() {
  [[ -d "$tmpdir" ]] && rm -rf "$tmpdir"
}
trap finish EXIT
cd "$tmpdir"

# Create the local CA Secret with ca.crt, tls.crt, tls.key

mkdir local-ca
cd local-ca
CAROOT="$(mkcert -CAROOT)"
cp -p "${CAROOT}/rootCA.pem" ca.crt
cp -p "${CAROOT}/rootCA.pem" tls.crt
cp -p "${CAROOT}/rootCA-key.pem" tls.key
kubectl create secret generic --from-file=.  --dry-run=client -o yaml local-ca > ../local-ca.yaml
cd ..

echo 'type: kubernetes.io/tls' >> local-ca.yaml
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: cert-manager
  name: cert-manager
spec:
  finalizers:
  - kubernetes
EOF
kubectl apply -n cert-manager --server-side=true -f local-ca.yaml

```

:::warning

Take care to run the local-ca script each time you create the workload cluster
so that Certificates are issued correctly.

:::

## Clean Up {#clean-up}

If you'd like to clean up the resources you created in this guide, remove them
with:

```bash
k3d cluster delete workload
```

## Reset {#reset}

If you'd like to reset to a known good state, execute the [Clean Up](#clean-up)
section, then [Create the Cluster](#create-the-cluster) and the [Setup Root
CA](#setup-root-ca) tasks.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a real cluster, apply and explore the manifests Holos renders
in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) guide.
