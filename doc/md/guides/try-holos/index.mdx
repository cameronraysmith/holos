# Try Holos Locally

This guide walks through the process of building and managing a software
development platform with Holos.  The k3d platform built in this guide is a
slimmed down version of the larger, more holistic, Holos reference platform.

Holos is different from existing tools in a few important ways.

 1. Holos provides a **unified configuration model** purpose built to improve on
 unmodified Helm charts, Kustomize bases, or anything else that produces
 structured configuration data.
 2. Holos all but **eliminates the need to template yaml**, a common source of
 frustration and errors in production.
 3. Holos platforms are **composable** and have breadth.  The toolchain and
 techniques scale down to one machine and up to multiple clusters across
 multiple regions.
 4. The unified configuration model is well suited to a **Zero Trust security
 model**.  Platform wide policy configuration is easier to manage with Holos.

---

This guide assumes commands are run locally.  Capitalized terms have specific
definitions described in the [Glossary](/docs/glossary).

## What you'll need {#Requirements}

Ensure you have the following tools installed to complete this guide.

1. [holos](/docs/guides/install) - to build the platform.
1. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - to render Holos components that wrap upstream Helm charts.
1. [k3d](https://k3d.io/#installation) - to provide a k8s api server.
1. [OrbStack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - to use k3d.
1. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - to interact with the k8s api server.
1. [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) - to make trusted TLS certificates.
1. [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) - to fiddle with JSON output.
1. [git](https://git-scm.com) - to interact with a GitOps repository.

:::note

Registering an account **is recommended** to try out proper authentication and
authorization in Holos, but you can complete this guide without signing up.

:::

## Goal {#Goal}

By the end of this guide you'll have built the foundation of a software
development platform.  The foundation provides Zero Trust security by
holistically integrating off-the-shelf open source software.

  1. Istio is configured to authenticate and authorize requests using an OIDC
  ID-Token issued by ZITADEL before requests reach backend services.
  2. The platform provides single sign-on and role based access control for all
  services running on the platform.

This guide strives to keep things neat and tidy.  All of the resources are
located in one k3d cluster and one local Git repository.  If you want to clean
up at any point, do so with:

```bash
k3d cluster delete workload
rm -rf holos-k3d
```

## Sign In or Out {#Sign-In}

Holos provides integrated authentication and authorization which we'll use in
this guide to protect a service.  We recommend registering an account to see
this in action.  Registration also enables you to explore the customizable web
form that simplifies complex configuration.

If you opt-out, the platform will be configured to use a fake identity in place
of real id tokens.

<Tabs groupId="registration">
  <TabItem value="registered" label="Sign In">
    ```bash
    holos register user
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unregistered" label="Opt Out">
    ```bash
    holos logout
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create the Platform {#Create-Platform}

A server-side platform resource in Holos stores the web form used to simplify
platform wide configuration.

First, initialize an empty Git repository:

```bash
mkdir holos-k3d
cd holos-k3d
git init
```

<Tabs groupId="registration">
  <TabItem value="registered" label="Signed In">
    Use `holos` to make the rpc call to create the server-side platform
    resource.

    ```bash
    holos create platform --name k3d --display-name "Try Holos Locally"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unregistered" label="Signed Out">
    Create a blank `platform.metadata.json` file so subsequent holos commands
    skip rpc calls.

    ```bash
    touch platform.metadata.json
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Generate the Platform {#Generate-Platform}

Generate the platform code in the repository root.

```bash
holos generate platform k3d
```

Commit the generated platform config to the repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "holos generate platform k3d - $(holos --version)"
```

### Push the Platform Form

Each Holos platform has a Platform Form used to submit top level, platform-wide
configuration values.  The purpose of the form is to validate configuration
values and simplify complicated configurations and integrations.

<Tabs groupId="registration">
  <TabItem value="registered" label="Signed In">
    Push the Platform Form to publish it.  Browse to the printed URL to view the
    form.

    ```bash
    holos push platform form .
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unregistered" label="Signed Out">
    Only registered and signed-in users can push a Platform Form to the Holos
    web server. And this guide will have you update the Platform Model locally,
    so there's nothing to do for this step.

    ```bash
    # holos push platform form .
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Platform Form is defined locally in `forms/platform/platform-form.cue`.

On the web it looks like:
![Platform Form Default Values](./form-pushed.png)

### Update the Platform Model {#Platform-Model}

Holos needs initial, top level configuration values to render the platform.  The
Platform Model is the term we use for these values.  In this section you will
configure role based access control by way of updating the Platform Model.

In the k3d platform you're building now, role based access control is
implemented by asserting against your oidc id token's subject claim.  Update
the form with the `sub` claim value from your id token.  This will ensure only
you have access to platform services.

<Tabs groupId="registration">
  <TabItem value="registered" label="Signed In">
    Copy and paste the `sub` value into your Platform Form's Subject field.

    ```bash
    holos login --print-claims --log-level=error | jq -r .sub
    ```

    After pasting the `sub` value, click Submit on the form.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unregistered" label="Signed Out">
    You don't have an id token when you're signed out, so there's nothing for
    you to do in this step.

    ```bash
    # holos login --print-claims --log-level=error | jq -r .sub
    ```

    The platform will be configured to assert against the User-Agent header
    instead.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Pull the Platform Model {#Pull-the-Platform-Model}

The Platform Model needs to be pulled into the local Git repository after the
form has been submitted. The `holos render` command, which we will execute next,
operates exclusively on local files.

Holos stores the Platform Model in the `platform.config.json` file. Holos
provides this file as input to CUE when rendering the platform.  This file is
intended to be added to version control.

<Tabs groupId="registration">
  <TabItem value="registered" label="Signed In">
    Pull the updated Platform Model into the local repository.

    ```bash
    holos pull platform model .
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unregistered" label="Signed Out">
    There is nothing to pull when signed out as there isn't an OIDC token sub
    value to add to the Platform Model.

    ```bash
    # holos pull platform model .
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```bash
git add platform.config.json
git commit -m "Add platform model"
```

## Render the Platform {#Render-the-Platform}

Holos has everything necessary to render the platform once the
`platform.config.json` file and the code from `holos generate` are in the
current directory.

Rendering a platform is the process of iterating over each platform component
and rendering it into plain yaml. Holos does not apply the resulting manifests.
Other tools like kubectl, ArgoCD, or Flux are responsible for applying the
manifests.

```bash
holos render platform ./platform
```

The render command writes the manifest files to the `deploy/` directory.  Commit
the files so they can be applied via GitOps later.

```bash
git add deploy
git commit -m "holos render platform ./platform"
```

:::important

âš¡ Don't blink, this is where Holos actually builds the platform.  It usually
takes no more than a few seconds.

Rendering the holos reference platform currently results in about 500K lines of
yaml.  In contrast, roughly 80K lines are produced by this slimmed down k3d
platform.

We mention this because the scale doesn't matter as much as it does with other
tools.  Manage millions of lines of configuration with Holos the same way this
guide manages thousands.  This is made possible by the unique way CUE unifies
all configuration into one single model.

:::

## Create the Cluster {#Create-Cluster}

The Workload Cluster is where your applications and services will be deployed.
In production this is usually an EKS, GKE, or AKS cluster.

:::tip

Holos supports all compliant Kubernetes clusters. Holos was developed and tested
on GKE, EKS, Talos, k3s, and Kubeadm clusters.

:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="evaluate" label="Try Holos" default>
  Use this command when exploring Holos.

  ```bash
  k3d cluster create workload \
    --port "443:443@loadbalancer" \
    --k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:0"
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="develop" label="Develop Holos">
  Use this command when developing Holos.

  ```bash
  k3d registry create registry.holos.localhost --port 5100
  ```

  ```bash
  k3d cluster create workload \
    --registry-use k3d-registry.holos.localhost:5100 \
    --port "443:443@loadbalancer" \
    --k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:0"
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Traefik is disabled because Istio provides the same functionality.

### Local CA {#Local-CA}

Holos platforms use cert manager to issue tls certificates.  The browser and
tools we're using need to trust these certificates to work together.  In this
section we'll create a local trusted certificate authority.

Admin access is necessary for `mkcert` to install the certificate into your
system's trust store.

```bash
sudo -v
```

```bash
bash ./scripts/local-ca
```

### DNS Setup {#DNS}

Configure your machine to resolve `*.holos.localhost` to your loopback
interface.  This is necessary for requests to reach the workload cluster.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>
  Cache sudo credentials.

  Admin access is necessary to setup a local dnsmasq instance and configure
  macOS's DNS resolver.

  ```bash
  sudo -v
  ```

  Resolve *.holos.localhost DNS queries to 127.0.0.1.

  ```bash
  bash ./scripts/local-dns
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    [NSS-myhostname](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nss-myhostname.8.html)
    ships with many Linux distributions and should resolve *.localhost
    automatically to 127.0.0.1.

    Otherwise it is installable with:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install libnss-myhostname
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    Ensure the loopback interface has at least the following names in `C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

    ```
    127.0.0.1 httpbin.holos.localhost app.holos.localhost
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Apply the Platform Components {#Apply-Platform-Components}

Use `kubectl` to apply each platform component.  In production, it's common to
fully automate this process with ArgoCD, but we use `kubectl` to the same
effect.

### Service Mesh

The platform service mesh provides an ingress gateway and connectivity useful
for observability, reliability, and security.

#### Namespaces

With Holos, components are automatically added to the namespaces component,
useful for centrally managed policies.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f ./deploy/clusters/workload/components/namespaces
```

#### Custom Resource Definitions

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f ./deploy/clusters/workload/components/gateway-api
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f ./deploy/clusters/workload/components/istio-base
```

#### Cert Manager {#cert-manager}

Apply the cert-manager controller.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f ./deploy/clusters/workload/components/cert-manager
```

Apply the ClusterIssuer which issues Certificate resources using the local
certificate authority.

```bash
kubectl -n cert-manager wait pod -l app.kubernetes.io/component=webhook --for=condition=Ready
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f deploy/clusters/workload/components/local-ca
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f deploy/clusters/workload/components/certificates
```

#### Istio {#Istio}

Istio implements the Service Mesh.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f ./deploy/clusters/workload/components/istio-cni
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f ./deploy/clusters/workload/components/istiod
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f ./deploy/clusters/workload/components/gateway
```

Verify the Gateway is programmed and the listeners have been accepted:

```bash
kubectl -n istio-gateways wait gateway default --for=condition=Accepted
```

#### httpbin {#httpbin}

httpbin is a simple backend service useful for end-to-end testing.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f deploy/clusters/workload/components/httpbin-backend
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f deploy/clusters/workload/components/httpbin-routes
kubectl -n holos-system wait pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=httpbin --for=condition=Ready
```

:::important

Browse to [https://httpbin.holos.localhost/](https://httpbin.holos.localhost/)
to verify end to end connectivity.  You should see the httpbin index page.

:::

### Authenticating Proxy

The auth proxy is responsible for authenticating browser requests, handling the
oidc authentication flow, and providing a signed id token to the rest of the
services in the mesh.

#### Cookie Secret

The auth proxy stores session information in an encrypted cookie.  Generate a
random cookie encryption Secret and apply.

```bash
LC_ALL=C tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom \
  | head -c 32 \
  | kubectl create secret generic "authproxy" \
    --from-file=cookiesecret=/dev/stdin \
    --dry-run=client -o yaml \
  | kubectl apply -n istio-gateways -f-
```

#### Deployment

The auth proxy Deployment receives requests from web browsers and responds with
an authentication decision.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f deploy/clusters/workload/components/authproxy
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f deploy/clusters/workload/components/authroutes
```

<Tabs groupId="registration">
  <TabItem value="registered" label="Signed In">
    Verify authentication is working by visiting
    [https://httpbin.holos.localhost/holos/authproxy](https://httpbin.holos.localhost/holos/authproxy).
    The auth proxy should respond with a simple `Authenticated` response.

    Istio will respond with `no healthy upstream` until the pod becomes ready.
    Wait for the pod to become ready with:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n holos-system wait pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=httpbin --for=condition=Ready
    ```

    Once authenticated, visit
    [https://httpbin.holos.localhost/holos/authproxy/userinfo](https://httpbin.holos.localhost/holos/authproxy/userinfo)
    which returns a subset of claims from your id token:

    ```json
    {
      "user": "275552236589843464",
      "email": "demo@holos.run",
      "preferredUsername": "demo"
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unregistered" label="Signed Out">
    The auth proxy will always try to sign you in when you are signed out, so
    there isn't much to do here.  Please do take a moment to glance at the
    Signed In tab to see how this would work if you were signed in.

    The `k3d` platform relies on `https://login.holos.run` to issue id tokens.
    Authorization has been configured against fake request headers instead of
    the real `x-oidc-id-token` header.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Authorization Policy

Configure authorization policies using attributes of the authenticated request.
Authorization policies route web requests through the auth proxy and then
validate all requests against the `x-oidc-id-token` header.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side=true -f deploy/clusters/workload/components/authpolicy
```

Istio make take a few seconds to program the Gateway with the
AuthorizationPolicy resources.

## Try out Zero Trust

A basic Zero Trust security model is now in place.  The platform authenticates
and authorizes requests before they reach the backend service.

### Browser

<Tabs groupId="registration">
  <TabItem value="registered" label="Signed In">
    The platform has been configured to authorize requests with a `x-oidc-id-token` header.

    1. Verify authentication is working by browsing to [https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request](https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request).
        - Refresh the page a few times.
        - The `httpbin` backend pods should echo back the `x-oidc-id-token`
        header injected by the auth proxy.
    2. Note the `x-oidc-id-token` header is not sent by your browser but is
    received by the backend service.
        - This design reduces the risk of exposing id tokens in the browser.
        - Browser request size remains constant as more claims are added to id
        tokens.
        - Reliability improves because id tokens often overflow request header
        buffers when they pass through middle boxes across the internet.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unregistered" label="Signed Out">
    The platform has been configured to authorize requests with a `User-Agent: anonymous` header.

    1. Open an incognito window (Cmd+Shift+N) to verify the platform is
    enforcing the authorization policy.
    2. Browse to
    [https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request](https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request)
    you should be redirected to the sign in page by the auth proxy.
        - You **do not** need to register or sign in.
        - This step verifies the platform is redirecting unauthenticated
        requests to the identity provider.
        - Navigate back or close and re-open an incognito window.
    3. Set your `User-Agent` header to `anonymous` using your browser developer tools.
        - For Chrome the process is described
        [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/override-user-agent#override_the_user_agent_string).
        - The purpose is to simulate an authenticated request.
    4. Browse to
    [https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request](https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request).
        - The platform should allow the request through to the backend pod.
        - `httpbin` should echo back your request which should contain `User-Agent: anonymous`.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Command Line

Verify unauthenticated requests are blocked by default outside the browser.

```bash
curl -I https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request
```

You should receive a `HTTP/2 302` response that redirects to `location:
https://login.holos.run` to start the oauth login flow.

Next, verify authenticated requests are allowed.

<Tabs groupId="registration">
  <TabItem value="registered" label="Signed In">
    The platform is configured to authenticate the id token present in the
    `x-oidc-id-token` header.

    ðŸ’¡ It also works with `grpcurl`.

    ```bash
    curl -H x-oidc-id-token:$(holos token) https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unregistered" label="Signed Out">
    The platform is configured to authorize any request with `User-Agent:
    anonymous` in place of validating the oidc id token.

    ðŸ’¡ Take a moment to click the Signed In tab, I don't want you to miss how
    cool `$(holos token)` is.

    ```bash
    curl -A anonymous https://httpbin.holos.localhost/dump/request
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should receive a response showing the request headers the backend received.

:::tip

Note how the platform secures both web browser and command line api access to
the backend httpbin service.  httpbin itself has no authentication or
authorization functionality.

:::

## Summary

Thank you for taking the time to try out Holos.  In this guide, you built the
foundation of a software development platform that:

 1. Provides a unified configuration model with CUE that
    - Supports unmodified Helm Charts, Kustomize Kustomizations, plain YAML.
    - Provides a web form to pass top level parameters.
 2. Reduces errors by eliminating the need to template unstructured text.
 3. Is composable and scales down to a local machine.
 4. Provides an way to safely configure broad authentication and authorization
 policy.

## Next Steps

Dive deeper with the following resources that build on the foundation you have now.

 1. Explore the [Rendering Process](/docs/design/rendering) in Holos.
 2. Dive deeper into the [Platform Manifests](./platform-manifests) rendered in this guide.
 3. Deploy [ArgoCD](/docs/guides/argocd) onto the foundation you built.
 4. Deploy [Backstage](/docs/guides/backstage) as a portal to the integrated platform components.

## Clean-Up

If you'd like to clean up the resources you created in this guide, remove them
with:

```bash
k3d cluster delete workload
rm -rf holos-k3d
```
