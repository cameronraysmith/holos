# Expose a Service

In this guide, you'll learn how to expose a service with Holos using the Gateway
API.

The [Concepts](/docs/concepts) page defines capitalized terms such as Platform
and Component.

## What you'll need {#requirements}

:::warning TODO
Complete this section once the steps are complete.

You'll need the following tools installed to complete this guide.

1. [holos](/docs/install) - to build the Platform.
2. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - to render Holos Components that
wrap upstream Helm charts.

Optionally, if you'd like to apply the rendered manifests to a real Cluster,
first complete the [localhost Guide](../local-cluster).

## Create a Git Repository

Start by initializing an empty Git repository. Holos operates on local files
stored in a Git repository.

<Tabs groupId="init">
  <TabItem value="command" label="Command">
    ```bash
    mkdir expose-a-service
    cd expose-a-service
    git init
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="output" label="Output">
    ```txt
    Initialized empty Git repository in /expose-a-service/.git/
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This guide assumes you will run commands from the root directory of the Git
repository unless stated otherwise.

## Generate the Platform {#Generate-Platform}

Start by generating a platform used as the basis for our guides.

```bash
holos generate platform guide
```

Commit the generated platform config to the repository.

<Tabs groupId="commit-platform">
  <TabItem value="command" label="Command">
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "holos generate platform guide - $(holos --version)"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="output" label="Output">
    ```txt
    [main (root-commit) 0b17b7f] holos generate platform guide - 0.93.3
     213 files changed, 72349 insertions(+)
     ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Manage httpbin {#manage-httpbin}

The platform you generated is currently empty. Run the following command to
generate a Holos Component for the
[httpbin](https://github.com/mccutchen/go-httpbin) service.

httpbin is a simple backend service useful for end-to-end testing.  In this
guide, we use httpbin as a example of a service your organization develops and
deploy onto your Platform.
