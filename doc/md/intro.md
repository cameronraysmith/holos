üßê Holos is a platform builder. It builds a hollistic software development platform composed of best-of-breed cloud native open source projects.  Holos is also a tool to make it easier to manage cloud infrastructure by providing a typed alternative to yaml templates.

## Features

Holos was built to solve two main problems:

 1. Building a platform is **time consuming and expensive**, usually taking 3 engineers 6-9 months of effort.  Holos provides a reference platform that enables an individual to build and customize their platform quickly.
 2. Configuration changes often lead to downtime.  Existing tools like Helm make it difficult to reason about the impact a configuration change will have.  Holos provides a unique, unified configuration model powered by CUE which makes it safer and easier to manage the platform.

In addition, a core principle of Holos is that Organizations gain value from owning the the platform they build on.  Avoid vendor lock-in, future price hikes, and licensing changes by building on a solid foundation of open source, cloud native computing foundation backed projects.

The following features are built into the Holos reference platform.
