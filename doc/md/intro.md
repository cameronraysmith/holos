# Introduction

‚ö°Ô∏è Holos will help you build your **software development platform in no time.**

üí∏ Building a software development platform is **time consuming and expensive**.  Spend more time building features for your customers and less time managing your development platform.

üí• Already have a platform?  Add new features and services to your platform easily with Holos.

üßê Holos is a platform builder. It builds a hollistic software development platform composed of best-of-breed cloud native open source projects.  Holos is also a tool to make it easier to manage cloud infrastructure by providing a typed alternative to yaml templates.

## Features

Holos was built to solve two main problems:

 1. Building a platform usually takes 3 engineers 6-9 months of effort.  Holos provides a reference platform that enables you to deploy and customize your platform in a fraction of the time.
 2. Configuration changes often cause outages.  Existing tools like Helm make it difficult to understand the impact a configuration change will have.  Holos provides a unique, unified configuration model powered by CUE that makes it safer and easier to roll out configuration changes.

A core principle of Holos is that organizations gain value from owning the the platform they build on.  Avoid vendor lock-in, future price hikes, and expensive licensing changes by building on a solid foundation of open source, cloud native computing foundation backed projects.

The following features are built into the Holos reference platform.
