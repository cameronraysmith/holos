# Quickstart Guide

This guide shows you the basics of how Holos.  You'll deploy a Helm chart to
Kubernetes using a Component to see how Holos makes the process safer, easier,
and more consistent.

## What you'll need {#Requirements}

You'll need the following tools installed to complete this guide.

1. [holos](/docs/install) - to build the platform.
2. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - to render Holos components that wrap upstream Helm charts.
3. [k3d](https://k3d.io/#installation) - to provide a Kubernetes API server.
4. [OrbStack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - to use k3d.
5. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - to interact with the k8s api server.

## Install Holos

Install Holos with the following command or other methods listed on the
[Installation](/docs/install/) page.

```bash
go install github.com/holos-run/holos/cmd/holos@latest
```

## Git repository

Start by initializing an empty Git repository.  Holos is designed to operate
against local files in a Git repository.

<Tabs groupId="init">
  <TabItem value="command" label="Command">
    ```bash
    mkdir holos-quickstart
    cd holos-quickstart
    git init
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="output" label="Output">
    ```txt
    Initialized empty Git repository in /holos-quickstart/.git/
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This guide assumes commands are run from the root directory of this Git
repository unless otherwise stated.

## Generate the Platform {#Generate-Platform}

Generate the Platform code in the repository root.  A Platform refers to all of
the software and services integrated together to provide your organization's
software development platform.  In this guide the platform will contain a single
Component to demonstrate how the concepts fit together.

```bash
holos generate platform quickstart
```

Commit the generated platform config to the repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "holos generate platform quickstart - $(holos --version)"
```
