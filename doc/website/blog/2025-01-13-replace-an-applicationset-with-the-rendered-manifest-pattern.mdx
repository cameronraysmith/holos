Kubernetes has a reputation for being too complex.  Complexity in software
engineering is often categorized as essential or accidental.  Methods to expose
services to the internet, deploy replicas, manage secrets, configure network
connectivity, and control access are examples of essential complexity.  They're
unavoidable no matter what tools we use.

Nevertheless, popular tools in the ecosystem bolster this reputation by
accidentally piling up layers of complexity unnecessarily.  For example, Helm
value override hierarchies and ArgoCD ApplicationSet templates.  Both tools
solve challenging, pervasive problems resulting in their widespread adoption.
Unfortunately the trade offs each one makes independently combine together
poorly.  Helm and ArgoCD ApplicationSets contribute more than their fair share
of accidental complexity to the Kubernetes ecosystem.

Consider the use case of deploying different versions of the same service to
multiple environments.  An ArgoCD ApplicationSet passing sets of values to one
Helm chart is a commonly recommended solution contributing three forms of
accidental complexity.

1. There are multiple layers of Go template abstractions.
2. Config values are silently written over at multiple layers in a hierarchy.
3. The intermediate and final configuration is remote and out of reach.

The rendered manifests pattern is an alternative solution leveraging Helm and
ArgoCD with less complexity.  The pattern reduces complexity by collapsing
multiple layers of Go templates and brings the configuration local, within our
reach.  It still relies on Helm value hierarchies when charts are reused across
environments, so it's no silver bullet, but we'll explain in follow up post how
Holos can eliminate the accidental complexity of a Helm value files hierarchy.

There is no widely agreed upon, freely available implementation of the rendered
manifest pattern.  Engineering teams have to decide whether to implement the
pattern from scratch or stick with the more complex, but built-in features of
Helm and ArgoCD.  These few options indicate a tooling gap in the ecosystem.
This gap pushes many organizations toward the accidental complexity of the
ApplicationSet solution.

Holos fills this gap by offering a thoughtful and complete implementation of the
rendered manifest pattern in one command line tool.  This article is the first
in a series exploring how Holos solves the same use case while avoiding the
accidental complexity.

This article walks step-by-step through the process of migrating an
ApplicationSet to Holos.  I'll explain why we feel the trades we made in Holos
are a net improvement.  At the end of the article you'll see how you can
continue leveraging GitOps with ArgoCD and Helm while gaining the ability to see
and comprehend complex configurations clearly, with fewer layers of abstraction.

## Layers of Complexity

Before diving into the step by step migration, let's explore exactly what we
mean by accidental complexity.  Consider the ApplicationSet and Helm value
hierarchy described in the final recommendation of _[Using Helm Hierarchies in
Multi-Source Argo CD Applications for Promoting to Different GitOps
Environments][tfa]_.  This particular ApplicationSet is a prime example because
the approach it takes is often recommended as a solution for deploying a service
to multiple clusters and environments.

Unfortunately the example provided requires us to hold _at least 7 layers of
abstraction_ in mind while considering the impact of a change.

- The ApplicationSet renders an Application template for each `config.json` file.
- Each Application `valueFiles` field introduces 5 more layers of potential overrides.
- The Helm Chart is another layer of text templates.

:::important
Consider the multiple layers of abstraction in the example provided compared
with their replacements shown in the [Goals](#goals) section.

import AppSetPath from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-02-layers-of-complexity/appset.path';
import AppSetYAML from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-02-layers-of-complexity/appset.yaml';
import DeploymentPath from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-02-layers-of-complexity/deployment.path';
import DeploymentYAML from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-02-layers-of-complexity/deployment.yaml';

<Tabs groupId="layers-of-complexity">
  <TabItem value="Application Template" label="Application Template">

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


These templates would be easier to comprehend if their intermediate state and
final configuration were within reach.  Unfortunately, it's stored in multiple
remote repositories and processed remotely in ArgoCD.   ArgoCD is like a black
box.  Intermediate state is inaccessible.  The final configuration is only
accessible after it's been applied, far too late to consider what impact a
change might have.

We know the complexity is accidental because we bypass these layers when we run
`kubectl edit`.  The configuration is fetched, manipulated locally, then pushed
back to the cluster without obfuscation.

We also know the complexity is real.  It's too easy to make mistakes when
configuration values are silently written over many times along the way.  For
example, we'll see how the very ApplicationSet we're migrating contains errors
which are difficult to fix without insight a tool like `holos` provides.

## Goals

We want to eliminate as many layers of accidental complexity as possible with as
few changes as possible.  Ideally we'll be able to directly see and manipulate
the final manifests as they will be applied to the cluster.  We also want the
migration to balance the conventions and idioms of Holos, Helm, and ArgoCD as
much as possible.

1. Eliminate as many layers of accidental complexity as possible.
2. Make as few changes as possible.
3. Bring intermediate state and the final configuration within our reach.
4. Use each tool idiomatically.

We'll relocate the unmodified Helm chart, config.json files, and value files to
make as few changes as possible.   We'll also generate Applications for ArgoCD
identical to those generated by the ApplicationSet, but we'll do so with the
same [CUE] layer that configures everything else in Holos.

The migration achieves these goals by rendering clearly readable Application and
Deployment resources to local files for ArgoCD to sync via GitOps.  Here's how
it will look.

:::important
Compare the Application and Deployment with the templates in the [Layers of
Complexity](#layers-of-complexity) section.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The manifests rendered at the end of the migration achieve the goals.

1. The Application rendered by Holos is readable and complete, replacing the ApplicationSet template rendered remotely.
2. The Application is equivalent to those produced by the ApplicationSet.
3. The final configuration is within reach in local files.  We'll see how Holos exposes intermediate state as we step through the migration in the next section.
4. Both ArgoCD and Helm are used idiomatically, passing the value files to render the chart for GitOps.

## Migration Steps

We'll migrate each of the three major behaviors of the ApplicationSet to Holos
to achieve the goals and complete the migration.

1. Generate an Application from a template using values provided by each `config.json` file.
2. Render `my-chart` to a manifest by providing a hierarchy of helm values determined by `config.json` values.
3. Reconcile the rendered manifest with the cluster state.

We'll start by loading the `config.json` environment data files into CUE without
modifying the original data.  Then we'll manage a Holos [Platform] [Component]
for each environment.  We'll wrap `my-chart` in a component definition
and pass the value hierarchy to `helm template` the same as ArgoCD does.
Finally, we'll mix an ArgoCD Application into each platform component to achieve
the same output as the ApplicationSet.

Along the way we'll see how Holos eliminates accidental complexity and makes it
easier to work with the intermediate and final configuration.

### Initial Setup

The main branch of the [multi-sources-example] is a fork of the example code
from the original article that has already been migrated.  We'll roll back to
the fork point then step through each of the commits to complete the migration.

First, clone the repository.

import GitCloneCommand from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-01-clone/clone.sh';
import GitCloneOutput from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-01-clone/clone.txt';

<Tabs groupId="clone">
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{GitCloneCommand}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
    <CodeBlock language="txt">{GitCloneOutput}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, reset to where it was forked from upstream.

import GitResetCommand from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-01-clone/reset.sh';
import GitResetOutput from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-01-clone/reset.txt';


<Tabs groupId="reset">
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{GitResetCommand}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
    <CodeBlock language="txt">{GitResetOutput}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

[Install Holos] if you haven't already.  This article has been tested with version:

import HolosVersionCmd from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-01-clone/version.sh';
import HolosVersionTxt from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-01-clone/version.txt';


<Tabs groupId="version">
  <TabItem value="Version" label="Version">

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{HolosVersionCmd}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Holos Structure

Holos is organized for use as a GitOps repository.  The main folders are:

| Folder | Description |
| - | - |
| platform | Entry point for `holos render platform` which renders all manifests. |
| config | Configuration data, we'll move the `config.json` files here. |
| components | Component definitions live here.  Components produce build plans for `holos` to render manifests.  We'll wrap `my-chart` in a reusable component definition. |
| deploy | Fully rendered manifests are written here for ArgoCD to sync. |
| cue.mod | [CUE] type definitions and schemas reside here. |


Initialize the platform.

import HolosInit from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-03-holos-structure/holos-init.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash">{"# --force is necessary when the current directory is not empty\n"+HolosInit}</CodeBlock>

Now that we've initialized the current directory as a Holos platform repository
we can move the example files from the original article into their conventional
locations in Holos.

import MoveFiles from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-03-holos-structure/move-files-around.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash">{MoveFiles}</CodeBlock>

### Environment Configs

The ApplicationSet generators field iterates over 8 config.json files to
instantiate each Application from the spec.template field.  We'll migrate this
to a similar mechanism in Holos by using CUE's `@embed` feature to load the same
files into one struct.  We'll manage one Helm Component for each config.json
value in the struct.  This struct will reside in the `config` field of the
`environments` package.  Like Go, CUE supports package imports for reuse.

These `config.json` files moved to the `config/environments/` folder.  The
`config` folder is the conventional place in Holos for reusable config values
like these.

:::important
Holos offers one unified layer with CUE to configure an entire platform
holistically, different from other tools like Helm and Kustomize.
:::

Here's how the environments package is defined in CUE.

import EnvironmentsPackageHeader from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-03-holos-structure/environments-header.sh';
import EnvironmentsPackageBody from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-03-holos-structure/environments.cue';
import EnvironmentsPackageTrailer from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-03-holos-structure/environments-trailer.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash">{EnvironmentsPackageHeader}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="cue" showLineNumbers>{EnvironmentsPackageBody}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="bash">{EnvironmentsPackageTrailer}</CodeBlock>

We moved the original `config.json` files without modifying them, then used
CUE's `@embed` feature to load them into the `config` struct.  This structure is
accessible in CUE by importing the `environments` package, then referencing
`environments.config`.

:::tip
Holos and CUE offer fast, local query and manipulation of your configuration
data, even in intermediate states.
:::

Here's how the environments package exports to YAML.  `cue export` and `cue
eval` are handy ways to query intermediate state.

import InspectEnvironmentsCommand from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-03-holos-structure/inspect-environments.sh';
import InspectEnvironmentsOutput from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-03-holos-structure/inspect-environments.txt';

<Tabs groupId="inspect-environments">
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{InspectEnvironmentsCommand}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
    <CodeBlock language="yaml" showLineNumbers>{InspectEnvironmentsOutput}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::important
CUE populates the `config` field on the first line of output from the `config: _ @embed(...)`
lines in `environments.cue`.
:::

Holos and CUE offer multiple improvements over the ApplicationSet we're
migrating from.

1. **Validation** - Each `config.json` file is validated against the `#Config` schema we defined.
2. **Ergonomics** - Holos enables fast, local queries over one unified
configuration.  The data is at hand.  We don't need a controller running in a
remote cluster.  We can query the intermediate config data structure, improving
our ability to troubleshoot problems the same way an interactive debugger gives
access to intermediate state.
3. **Flexibility** - We're no longer locked into ArgoCD functionality.  The
`environments` package can be imported and re-used across the unified platform
configuration layer.  We're able to continue processing the rendered manifests
with other tools beyond just ArgoCD.

We've successfully migrated the ApplicationSet generator field to Holos.  Next,
we'll iterate over this structure to render `my-chart` for each environment.

### Rendering my-chart

The next step is to render `my-chart` into complete configuration manifests.
Holos implements the same behavior as the Application's `spec.sources.helm`
field.  Both tools use Helm to render the chart.  Holos is different though, it
offers a flexible way to transform and validate the output of Helm, then stops
once the manifest is written to a local file.  ArgoCD doesn't persist rendered
manifests, instead it applies them directly to the cluster.

Where Holos stops is another major difference from ArgoCD and all other tools
operating as a controller in the cluster.  Holos is designed for GitOps and
integration with the rest of the Kubernetes ecosystem.  Holos stops after it
writes manifests to local files.  This clear cut responsibility leaves ample
space for subsequent automated workflow operating on the configuration Holos
produces.

For example, consider a progressive delivery pipeline at the right side of this
diagram to incrementally roll out configuration changes.  ApplicationSets with a
Helm source prevents this kind of integration.  Holos with an Application Git
source enables this kind of integration.

import RenderingOverview from '@site/src/diagrams/rendering-overview.mdx';

<RenderingOverview />

ArgoCD pairs well with other ecosystem tools when it keeps to what it does best:
drift detection and reconciliation following GitOps principles.  ArgoCD locks
out other tools when it renders manifests.  The configuration is transient and
locked away in the cluster.

:::important
Holos renders `my-chart` to local files, one for each of the environment configs
we migrated to the `environments` package.
:::

### Platform Components

The primary entrypoint for Holos is the `platform/` directory.  The `holos
render platform` command processes a [Platform] specification exported by CUE
from this directory.

Each Application produced by the ApplicationSet we're migrating maps to a
[Component] listed in the `Platform.spec.components` field.  Here's how the
components are added to the Platform in CUE.

{/* 987df87 add platform components to replace ApplicationSets.spec.generators */}

import PlatformChartHeader from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/platform-my-chart-header.sh';
import PlatformChartBody from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/platform-my-chart.cue';
import PlatformChartTrailer from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/platform-my-chart-trailer.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash">{PlatformChartHeader}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="cue" showLineNumbers>{PlatformChartBody}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="bash">{PlatformChartTrailer}</CodeBlock>

For each of the data objects defined in the `config.json` files, we define a
field in the `Platform.Components` struct.  We use a struct for convenience,
it's easier to compose components into a struct than it is into an ordered list.
The Platform author schema converts this struct into the `spec.components` list.

`#MyChart` is a schema  definition acting as a reusable template.  For each of
the environment config files we build the component configuration from
parameters.  This is an example of how we compose configuration.  The
`outputBaseDir` field is composed in from the `env` field configured in the
original `config.json` files migrated to CUE.

We need to add a configuration snippet so each component accepts this parameter
and renders manifests into folders organized by environment.  The use of `@tag`
with the `OutputBaseDir` field indicates the field value is provided by the
Platform spec when we run `holos render platform`.

import ComponentConfigHeader from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/componentconfig-header.sh';
import ComponentConfigBody from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/componentconfig.cue';
import ComponentConfigTrailer from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/componentconfig-trailer.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash">{ComponentConfigHeader}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="cue" showLineNumbers>{ComponentConfigBody}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="bash">{ComponentConfigTrailer}</CodeBlock>

We can gain insight into how `holos` renders the helm charts from the
`config.json` files with the following command.  CUE exports the `Platform`
specification to `holos`, which iterates over each of the listed components to
produce a `BuildPlan`.

import ShowPlatformCommand from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/holos-show-platform.sh';
import ShowPlatformOutput from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/holos-show-platform.txt';

<Tabs groupId="show-platform">
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{ShowPlatformCommand}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
    <CodeBlock language="yaml" showLineNumbers>{ShowPlatformOutput}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Component Definition

The next step is to wrap `my-chart` in a Holos [Helm] component definition.
Here's how:

import ComponentHeader from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/component-my-chart-header.sh';
import ComponentBody from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/component-my-chart.cue';
import ComponentFooter from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/component-my-chart-trailer.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash">{ComponentHeader}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="cue" showLineNumbers>{ComponentBody}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="bash">{ComponentFooter}</CodeBlock>

Note how each parameter we added in the Platform spec is reflected in the
component definition with a `@tag`.  These are CUE build tags, and the mechanism
by which parameters are passed from `holos render platform` to each component.

Similar to the `config.json` files we migrated, we moved the Helm value files
without modifying them.   These files are loaded into one struct in CUE using
`valueFiles: _ @embed(...)`.

Like the Platform spec, we can inspect the BuildPlans `holos` executes to render
each component to manifest files.

import ShowBuildPlansCmd from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/show-buildplans.sh'
import ShowBuildPlansOut from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/show-buildplans.txt'

<Tabs groupId="show-buildplans">
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{ShowBuildPlansCmd}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
    <CodeBlock language="yaml" showLineNumbers>{ShowBuildPlansOut}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can also inspect intermediate configuration like the `valueFiles` struct.

import ValueFilesCommand from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/inspect-value-files.sh'
import ValueFilesOutput from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/inspect-value-files.txt'

<Tabs groupId="inspect-value-files">
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{ValueFilesCommand}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
    <CodeBlock language="yaml" showLineNumbers>{ValueFilesOutput}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Render the platform to render `my-chart` for each of the configured
environments.

import RenderCommand from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/render.sh'
import RenderOutput from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/render.txt'

<CodeBlock language="bash">{RenderCommand}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="txt">{RenderOutput}</CodeBlock>

Holos processes the Platform spec.components field concurrently, rendering each
environment to a manifest file into the `deploy` folder.  The output looks like:

import TreeCommand from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/tree-deploy.sh'
import TreeOutput from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-04-helm-component/tree-deploy.txt'

<Tabs groupId="tree-deploy">
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{TreeCommand}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
    <CodeBlock language="txt">{TreeOutput}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### ArgoCD Application

At this point we're rendering `my-chart` with Holos for each environment.  The
intermediate and final configuration is within our reach.  The final step is to
render an Application resource for each environment like the original
ApplicationSet did.

Holos offers [ComponentConfig] for the purpose of mixing in configuration to
components.  The feature is often used to pass each component through
`kustomize` to add common labels and annotations.  It's also used to mix in
GitOps resources like ArgoCD Applications and Flux Kustomizations.

Here's how to add an Application for every one of the `Platform` components:

{/* d9125b8 compose argocd application resources into every component */}

import ComponentConfigGitOpsHeader from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-05-application/componentconfig-gitops-header.sh';
import ComponentConfigGitOpsBody from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-05-application/componentconfig-gitops.cue';
import ComponentConfigGitOpsTrailer from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-05-application/componentconfig-gitops-trailer.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash">{ComponentConfigGitOpsHeader}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="cue" showLineNumbers>{ComponentConfigGitOpsBody}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="bash">{ComponentConfigGitOpsTrailer}</CodeBlock>

More information about how this works is available in the following pages.  For
now, it's sufficient to know the ComponentConfig is something we usually set and
forget.

1. [ComponentConfig]
2. [GitOps](/docs/v1alpha5/topics/gitops/)

Now we can render the platform and see each of the Application manifest files.
They go into a `gitops` folder so it easy to apply them individually or all at
once for ArgoCD to sync the component manifests.

import AppRenderCommand from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-05-application/render.sh'
import AppRenderOutput from '!!raw-loader!./_migrate_appset/script-05-application/render.txt'

<CodeBlock language="bash">{AppRenderCommand}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="txt">{AppRenderOutput}</CodeBlock>

<Tabs groupId="tree-deploy-with-application">
  <TabItem value="Command" label="Command">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{AppTreeCommand}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Output" label="Output">
    <CodeBlock language="txt">{AppTreeOutput}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Applications are also fully rendered.

<CodeBlock language="txt">{AppPath}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="yaml">{AppYAML}</CodeBlock>

Note how the Application resources Holos produces are easier to read and
understand than the original ApplicationSet.

1. There is no templating.
2. There is no helm source, no value hierarchy to comprehend.

We also have the fully rendered manifest clearly readable and within reach locally.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{"# "+ManifestPath+ManifestYAML}</CodeBlock>

## Wrapping it all up

1. The manifests are fully rendered and within our reach.
2. The Application is clear and at-hand.
3. We now have a unified platform configuration layer.

## Next Steps

- Part 2 - Why are there 8 config.json files but only 7 components rendered?  There's a bug!
- Part 3 - Can we eliminate the layers of helm value overrides?  Yes!
- Part 4 - Progressive Delivery.  Maybe?
