We've added support for [Validators] in [v0.101.0].  Validators are useful to
enforce policies and ensure consistency early in the process.  This feature
addresses two primary use cases:

1. Prevent insecure configuration early in the process.  For example, prevent
Helm from rendering a `Secret` which would otherwise be committed to version control.
2. Prevent unsafe configuration by validating manifests against Kubernetes core
and custom resource type definitions.

Check out the [Validators] tutorial for examples of both use cases.

<RenderingOverview />

Validators complete the core functionality of the Holos manifest rendering
pipeline.  We are seeking design partners to help enhance Generators and
Transformers.  Validators are implemented using a generic `Command` kind, and
we're considering a similar kind for Generators and Transformers.  Please
connect with us if you'd like to help design these enhancements.
