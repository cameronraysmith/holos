# Guides

## Technical Overview

Please see the [Technical Overview] to learn about Holos.  If you're ready to
drive in and try Holos, please work through the following guides.

## Bank of Holos
The guides are organized as a progression.  We'll use Holos to manage a
fictional bank's platform, the Bank of Holos in each of the guides.  In doing so
we'll take the time to explain the foundational concepts of Holos.

1. [Quickstart] covers the foundational concepts of Holos.
2. [Deploy a Service] explains how to deploy a containerized service using an
existing Helm chart.  This guide then explains how to deploy a similar service
safely and consistently with CUE instead of Helm.
3. [Change a Service] covers the day two task of making configuration changes to
deployed services safely and consistently.
