# PG Bouncer

Every few days ZITADEL fails.  The problem seems to be related to pgbouncer not
being able to resolve DNS.  Restarting the pgbouncer pod fixes the issue.

See [How to load-balance queries between several servers?](https://www.pgbouncer.org/faq.html#how-to-load-balance-queries-between-several-servers)

> [!NOTE]
> DNS round-robin. Use several IPs behind one DNS name. PgBouncer does not look up DNS each time a new connection is launched. Instead, it caches all IPs and does round-robin internally. Note: if there are more than 8 IPs behind one name, the DNS backend must support the EDNS0 protocol. See README for details.

## Workaround

```sh
# Get the tls based creds to bypass oidc
(cd ~/.kube && holos get secret core2-kubeconfig-admin --print-key kubeconfig.admin > core2.admin)
export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/core2.admin
# Restart pgbouncer
kubectl -n prod-iam rollout restart deployment zitadel-pgbouncer
```

## Symptom logs

```sh
kubectl -n prod-iam logs -c pgbouncer -l postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/role=pgbouncer
```

### [host](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html#host)

> Host name or IP address to connect to. Host names are resolved at connection time, the result is cached per dns_max_ttl parameter. When a host nameâ€™s resolution changes, existing server connections are automatically closed when they are released (according to the pooling mode), and new server connections immediately use the new resolution. If DNS returns several results, they are used in a round-robin manner.

### dns_max_ttl

[dns_max_ttl](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html#dns_max_ttl)

How long DNS lookups can be cached. The actual DNS TTL is ignored.

Default: 15.0 (seconds)
