# Machine Room Provisioner

This sub-tree contains Holos Components to manage a [Choria Provisioner][1]
system for the use case of provisioning `holos controller` instances.  These
instances are implementations of Machine Room which are in turn implementations
of Choria Server, hence why we use Choria Provisioner.
