Building and maintaining a software development platform is a complex and time
consuming endeavour.  Organizations often dedicate a team of 3-4 who need 6-12
months to build the platform.

Holos is a tool and a reference platform to reduce the complexity and speed up
the process of building a modern, cloud native software development platform.

- **Accelerate new projects** - Reduce time to market and operational complexity by starting your new project on top of the Holos reference platform.
- **Modernize existing projects** - Incrementally incorporate your existing platform services into Holos for simpler integration.
- **Unified configuration model** - Increase safety and reduce the risk of config changes with CUE.
- **First class Helm and Kustomize support** - Leverage and reuse your existing investment in existing configuration tools such as Helm and Kustomize.
- **Modern Authentication and Authorization** - Holos seamlessly integrates platform identity and access management with zero-trust beyond corp style authorization policy.
